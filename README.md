## üìå Project Summary

**Time-Series Labeling** is often expensive and labor-intensive due to the need for dense annotations across long sequences. This project focuses on improving Active Learning (AL) for time-series classification by leveraging **coherent temporal patterns**, known as **plateaus**, for efficient label propagation.

---

##  Core Idea from the Paper

- Instead of labeling random timestamps, the original method finds **‚Äúplateaus‚Äù** ‚Äî temporally consistent regions ‚Äî and propagates labels within them.
- Uses a **segmentation model (e.g., MSTCN)** to guide propagation.
- Propagation improves sample efficiency in **low-label regimes**.

##  Contributions

I went beyond replication and explored several **novel extensions**:

###  1. **Meta Active Learning Scheduler**
- Dynamically switches AL strategies (e.g., margin ‚Üí core ‚Üí badge) based on training rounds.
- Learns when to explore and when to exploit.
- Boosted F1@25 and stabilized learning curves.

###  2. **Class Coverage Aware Initialization**
- Ensures **at least 1 sample per class** in initial labels.
- Prevents under-representation of rare classes (e.g., Class 11 in mHealth).
- Improved early-stage generalization and propagation accuracy.

###  3. **Weighted AL Strategy (wt_cem)**
- Combines entropy, core-set, and margin scores with tunable weights.
- Balanced uncertainty, diversity, and representativeness.
- Shown to improve performance on mHealth dataset.
